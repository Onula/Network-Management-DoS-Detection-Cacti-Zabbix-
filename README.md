# Network Management & DoS Detection (Cacti & Zabbix)

This project was developed as part of the course **"Computer Networks Development and Management"** at the University of Macedonia.

## Overview
Focuses on:
- Installation and configuration of **Cacti** and **Zabbix** for network monitoring.
- Comparison of their features, scalability, and usability.
- Simulation and detection of **DoS attacks**:
  - SYN Flood (hping3)
  - Slowloris
  - Slowhttptest
- Implementation using **VirtualBox** with multiple **Ubuntu Server VMs** and a **Windows client**.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, Windows 10  
- **Virtualization**: Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Monitoring Tools**: Cacti (with Spine & plugins), Zabbix  
- **Protocols**: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)  
- **Attack Tools**: hping3, slowloris, slowhttptest  

## Results
- Comparative analysis of **Cacti vs Zabbix** in terms of usability, scalability, and accuracy.  
- Detection and visualization of **DoS attack traffic** using both tools.  
- Evaluation of which tool is more effective for different scenarios.
